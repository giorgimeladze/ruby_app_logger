# README

This README documents this project and tells how to run the commands

We have main.rb in the main directory and then lib directory with all the classes that main.rb uses directly or indirectly to do its job.

In order for the RUN commands to work, you need to be in ruby_app main directory
# RUN:
1. Run ruby main.rb webserver.log in ruby_app folder
2. Run rspec spec also in ruby_app folder to check if all tests are passing
3. Run rubocop -A <dir> to correct Rubocop mistakes

# What to Improve:
names of the files can be rewritten and make much more undestandable, also generators and services directories can be renamed
