# README

This README documents this project and tells how to run the commands

We have main.rb in the main directory and then lib directory with all the classes that main.rb uses directly or indirectly to do its job.

# RUN:
1. Run ruby main.rb webserver.log in ruby_app folder
2. Run rspec spec also in ruby_app folder to check if all tests are passing
